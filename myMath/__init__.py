# This file just tells that the myMath folder (parent directory) holds a Python package
# Each .py file in this directory is a module

# This allows the following code segements (assuming this directory is part of the path):
"""
# Contains all of the modules, classes, and functions defined in the myMath folder
import myMath

# Contains all of the classes and functions defined in the matematicas.py module
from myMath import matematicas
